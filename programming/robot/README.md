# Introduction
In this exercise, we complete the implementation of the robot program, by completing the implementation of the robot.cpp program. The robot program is a simple program that simulates a robot that can move around in a 2D space. The robot can move forward, backward, left and right. The robot can also turn left and right. The robot can also report its current position and direction.

The requirements are given as a set of expected outputs (in an image format not included in this repository)

# Compile
To compile run the compile.sh

# Clean
To clean the build, run clean.sh
